/ This example demonstrates the new skipcond instruction via a < comparison

/ text section
	Load X
	Skipcond 005	/ 005 HEX == 0000 0000 0005 BIN
			/ First 2 bits == 0, therefore we are doing a less than comparison
			/ Other 10 bits ==  5, so we skip the next instruction if the value in the AC is < 5
	Load Y
	Halt

/ data section
X, 	DEC 2
Y, 	DEC 10
